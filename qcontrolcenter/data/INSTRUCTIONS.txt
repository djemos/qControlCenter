*** qControlCenter INSTRUCTIONS ***

STEP 1
------
In order to use qControlCenter you have to create a main structure directory. For instance : 

# mkdir /etc/qcontrolcenter

By default, qControlCenter uses /etc/qcontrolcenter as base structure directory.


STEP 2
------
Inside the folder created above, create subdirectories corresponding to the control center categories. Example :

# cd /etc/qcontrolcenter 
# mkdir Boot
# mkdir Devices
# mkdir NetworkAndInternet
# mkdir Security
# mkdir System


STEP 3
------
You have to fill those directories with some '.desktop' files. Most of them are usually located in '/usr/share/applications'. You may copy or link the .desktop files in a subdirectory of your choice. Example :

# cd /etc/qcontrolcenter/Devices
# ln -s /usr/share/applications/cups.desktop
# ln -s /usr/share/applications/hplip.desktop
# ln -s /usr/share/applications/nvidia-settings.desktop


STEP 4
------
You may create an icon for your section. qControlCenter uses the file named 'icon.png' in your subdirectory as icon for the section (example : /etc/qcontrolcenter/Devices/icon.png)


STEP 5
------
You also may want to customize the name of the section in your language. Create a file named 'folder.ini' (example : /etc/qcontrolcenter/Devices/folder.ini) and write it like this :

default=Hardware
fr=Périphériques
it=...
de=...
ru=...

qControlCenter detects automatically your language.
Note : 'default=' means english.
